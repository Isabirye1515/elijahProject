    God called Bill Clinton, Boris Yeltsin and Bill Gates to come to a conference.   And when they were all there, God said, "Ive got good news and Ive got bad news. The bad news is that Im really fed up with the way things are on Earth; so, Ive decided to destroy it. The good news is that Im giving you one weeks notice."    So, Bill Clinton called into session the joint houses of Congress and announced, "Ive got good news and Ive got bad news. The good news is there is a God. The bad news is that hes going to destroy the Earth in one week."    Boris Yeltsin called into session the Communist Party and announced, "Ive got bad news and worse news. The bad news is that there is a God after all. And the worse news is that hes going to destroy the Earth in one week."    Bill Gates called all of his programmers, marketing experts and administrators together and announced, "Ive got good news and Ive got better news. The good news is that God thinks Im one of the three most important men on Earth. The better news is that we dont have to fix Windows 95."
